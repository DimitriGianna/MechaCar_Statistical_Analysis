# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## 1. Linear Regression to Predict MPG

mpg:  0<0.05  statistically significant, non-random
vehicle length: 0<0.05, statistically significant, non-random
vehicle weight: 0.08>0.05, not statistically significant, random
spoiler angle: 0.31>0.05, not statistically significant, random
ground clearance: 0<0.05, statistically significant, non-random
AWD:  0.19>0.05, not statistically significant, random

Vehicale length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
All of the variables have slopes that are not equal to zero however some are very close to zero.


## 2. Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The variance for all of the lots does not exceed 100 (62<100). However, When the lots are examined individually, Lot 1 and Lot 2 are well within specification while Lot 3 far exceeds it (170>100).

## 3. T-Test on Suspension Coils

### T-Test for all Lots


## 4. Designing a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
